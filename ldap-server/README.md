# What is adop-ldap?

adop-ldap is a wrapper for the dinkel/openldap image. It has primarily been built to perform extended configuration.
OpenLDAP Software is an open source implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.

# How to use this image

The easiest way to run adop-ldap image is as follow:
```
docker run --name <your-container-name> -d -p 389:389 accenture/adop-ldap:VERSION
```

Runtime configuration can be provided using environment variables:

* `SLAPD_PASSWORD`, the LDAP admin password. Default to Jpk66g63ZifGYIcShSGM
* `SLAPD_DOMAIN`, the LDAP domain. Default to ldap.example.com
* `SLAPD_FULL_DOMAIN`, the LDAP BASE_DN. Default to dc=ldap,dc=example,dc=com
* `INITIAL_ADMIN_USER`, the initial LDAP user name with administrator rights
* `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, the password for the initial administrator user
* `SLAPD_ADDITIONAL_SCHEMAS`, loads additional schemas provided in the `slapd` package that are not installed using the environment variable with comma-separated enties. As of writing these instructions, there are the following additional schemas available: `collective`, `corba`, `duaconf`, `dyngroup`, `java`, `misc`, `openldap`, `pmi` and `ppolicy`.
* `SLAPD_ADDITIONAL_MODULES`, comma-separated list of modules to load. It will try to run `.ldif` files with a corresponsing name from the `module` directory. Currently only `memberof` and `ppolicy` are avaliable.
* `SLAPD_PPOLICY_DN_PREFIX` - (defaults to `cn=default,ou=policies`) sets the dn prefix used in `modules/ppolicy.ldif` for the `olcPPolicyDefault` attribute.  The value used for `olcPPolicyDefault` is derived from `$SLAPD_PPOLICY_DN_PREFIX,(dc component parts from $SLAPD_DOMAIN)`.
* `SLAPD_LDIF_BASE`, the base directory where from ldifs can be loaded. Default to "/var/tmp/ldifs".
* `SLAPD_LOAD_LDIFS`, comma-separated list of ldifs you want to load from ldifs base. This will assume that ldifs are available in SLAPD_LDIF_BASE.
